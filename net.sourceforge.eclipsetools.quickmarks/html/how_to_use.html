		<h1 class="head">Quickmarks Plugin: How to use it</h1>
		<p>With default settings:</p>
		<h2>1. Set a Quickmark</h2>
		<p>Move the cursor to some location of interest, even highlight/select 
			some region in your text editor and press <em 
			class="Key">Shift+Ctrl+9</em>. Note the icon in the bar left to the 
			editor: it will show a decorated 9. Note also the (yellow) mark in 
			the overview bar to the right of your editor and the message in the 
			statusline ... which disappears after some short time.</p>

				title="display of a Quickmark left/right to the editor"/></p>
		<p>
			<img src="img/sl_setmark.gif" alt="" title="newly set a Quickmark"/></p>

		<h2>2. Jump to a Quickmark</h2>
		<p>Move the cursor elsewhere, or close the editor/document with the 
			Quickmark 9, even close <strong>all</strong> Editors. Now press <em 
			class="Key">Alt+9</em>. Instantly you'll be taken to the same 
			location you have set the Quickmark on, opening the right editor 
			when required. Your previous selection is remebered and 
			highlighted. Note the message in the statusline.</p>
		<p>
			<img src="img/sl_gotomark.gif" alt="" 
				title="jumped to a Quickmark"/></p>

		<h2>3. Delete a Quickmark</h2>
		<p>Jump to a Quickmark as described above, then try to add the same 
			mark number again <em class="Key">Shift+Ctrl+9</em>; this time the 
			Quickmark will be deleted. Trying to set a Quickmark at the same 
			location twice is interpreted as a delete request. The decorations 
			left/right to the editor disappear and the delete is messaged in 
			the statusline.</p>
		<p>

				title="deleted a Quickmark"/></p>

		<h2>4. Move a Quickmark</h2>
		<p>Having a Quickmark 9 set somewhere move the cursor/selection 
			elsewhere, be it in the same or any other document, even in a 
			totally unrelated project. Then try to add the same mark number 
			again <em class="Key">Shift+Ctrl+9</em>. The old mark is deleted 
			and a new mark with the same number is set at the current location 
			(the Quickmark is moved).</p>
		<p>Most probably you will not see the removal of the old mark. The old 
			mark might be far away, even in some other document. Note the 
			statusline message, it indicates what happened. There is no undo 
			(yet) for marker moving. The old position is silently lost!</p>
