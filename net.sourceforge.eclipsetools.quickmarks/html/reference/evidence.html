	<h1 class="head">Quickmarks Plugin: Evidence in the user interface</h1>
	<p>Although the Quickmarks are primarily meant to be used just by keyboard 
		shortcuts they show up in several places in the UI.</p>
	<h2>1. Left and right to the editor</h2>
	<p>Left of the current editor (the marker bar) Quickmarks show up with 
		special icons: the Quickmark number decorated.</p>
	<p>With default settings the Quickmarks show up in the overview ruler right 
		to the editor also as little yellow marks (this depends on the markers 
		beeing a 'problemmarker' or 'bookmark', see <a 
		href="visibility.html">Changing visibility in views</a>).</p>
	<p><img src="../img/setmark.gif" alt="" 
			title="display of a Quickmark left/right to the editor"/></p>

	<h2>2. Status line</h2>
	<p>Every attempt to set/move/delete/jump to a Quickmark is shown in the 
		statusline with an appropriate message telling you what happened. This 
		message is automatically removed after some time, if you do nothing, 
		and immediately, when you change the current selection (simple cursor 
		movement doesn't count, select some text region, switch editors, 
		activate some view).</p>
	<p>Failed attempts are messaged in red and accompanied by a beep. Look at 
		the statusline to see the reason. Failures are usually harmless, e.g. 
		"No Quickmark # to go to ..." or "Can't set Quickmark #: 
		&lt;reason&gt;".</p>
	<p><img src="../img/sl_nogoto.gif" alt="" title="a harmless error message"/>
	</p>
	<p>Severe errors are logged and the plugin opens/shows the error log 
		automatically. If this happens to you then please consider a bug 
		report to us.</p>

	<a id="menu" name="menu"></a>
	<h2>3. Menu</h2>
	<p>You can set/move/delete and jump to Quickmarks using the "Navigate" 
		menu, if you prefer. This is also a place to look for the active key 
		bindings, if you changed and have forgotten about them. See also
		<a href="#keybinding">Key binding</a> below.</p>
	<p><img src="../img/menu.gif" alt="" title="Quickmark menu"/></p>
	<p>Notice the 2 'Go to' alternatives for Mark 0. With only one Quickmark 0 
		set there is no behaviour difference. But you can have multiple 
		Quickmarks with the same number (by accident or by intention, see <a 
		href="preference.html#multiple">Handling Multiple Marks</a>). Then the 
		behaviour is to move forward from the current selection to the next 
		existing Quickmark for all 'Go to Mark' actions except for <em>Go to 
		previous Mark 0</em>, which moves backward. Quickmark 0 is also the one 
		used, when this plugin is changed to behave in <a href="styles.html">"M 
		company Style"</a>. A last reason for this additional action is, that 
		the default key binding <em class="Key">Alt+0</em> is hidden by the 'Cut 
		to Beginning of Line' action in the 'Emacs' configuration bound to <em 
		class="Key">Alt+0 Ctrl+K</em>, so there is an alternate binding 
		available to the experimenting Emacs user.</p>

	<h2>4. Task view</h2>
	<p>As delivered the Quickmarks show up as INFO items in the task view. 
		Although this might clutter your task view we consider this a feature: 
		the task view has the option of advanced filtering and sorting it's 
		list, you have an overview of your Quickmarks and can jump to them with 
		the mouse. If you don't like this, you can change it, see <a 
		href="visibility.html">Changing visibility in views</a>. But more 
		easily you just might filter out Quickmarks to be not shown in the task 
		view (or even show only Quickmarks, try it). You can't edit or delete a 
		Quickmark from this view by default.</p>
	<p><img src="../img/taskview.gif" alt="" 
			title="task view with 2 Quickmarks set"/></p>
	<p><img src="../img/filter.gif" alt="" 
			title="Filtering out Quickmarks from task view"/></p>

	<h2>5. Bookmarks view</h2>
	<p>By default the Quickmarks also show up in the bookmarks view. Here you 
		have the option of changing the name of the Quickmark, for instance to 
		add a minor comment (from the context menu of a bookmark >> 
		Properties). The changed description shows up in the task view too. You 
		again can <a href="visibility.html">change the plugin</a>, so that the 
		Quickmarks ain't shown in the bookmarks view at all. But having 
		Quickmarks in this view has several advantages: the Quickmarks 
		description is editable and the Quickmark is <strong>deletable</strong> 
		from within this view. Also this view normally is much less cluttered 
		than the task view.</p>
	<p><img src="../img/bookmarkview.gif" alt="" 
			title="bookmarks view with 2 Quickmarks set"/></p>
	<p>Be aware that when you rename a Quickmark via this view this will NOT 
		change the Quickmark into a regular bookmark, it remains to be a 
		Quickmark and is still considered as a candidate for jumping and beeing 
		automatically deleted as any other Quickmark. So, don't add important 
		comments via the bookmarks view for a Quickmark! Consider adding a 
		normal bookmark or a task at that location instead.</p>

	<a id="keybinding" name="keybinding"></a>
	<h2>6. Key binding</h2>
	<p>You can change the default key binding via the Preferences 
		Workbench >> Keys. They are found inside the Navigate section.</p>
	<p><img src="../img/pref_key1.gif" alt="" 
			title="Quickmarks keyboard preferences"/></p>
	<p>Note, that with the default key binding there is a conflict for jumping 
		to Quickmark 0. We've still choosen this binding, as it feels natural, 
		Emacs users possibly are happy with their special "point and mark" 
		feature anyway, or finally might just don't use Quickmark 0 by 
		unbinding "Set Quickmark 0" in their "Emacs" configuration.</p>
	<p>You can change the key bindings for this extension. Feel free to do it. 
		Remember, that Eclipse has Emacs style key binding support too, so you 
		can have a prefix key, say <em 
		class="Key">Ctrl+M&nbsp;0</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em 
		class="Key">Ctrl+M&nbsp;9</em>.</p>
	<p>If you prefer 'pure' B company style or M company style, please read the
		section <a href="styles.html">switching to another style</a>.</p>
	<p>If you rebind yourself, would you please consider to tell us: what keys 
		have you choosen and why felt you that to be nessessary?</p>

	<h2>7. Customize Perspective</h2>
	<p>To have the Quickmarks available in perspectives you already had
		customized before installing the Quickmarks, you must customize these
		perspectives again and enable "Quickmarks Both Styles" in the "Other"
		section.</p>
	<p>Perspectives not yet customized have the Quickmarks enabled by default.</p>
	<p><img src="../img/cust_perspective.gif" alt="" 
			title="Quickmarks enabled in customize perspective"/></p>

	<h2>8. Startup</h2>
	<p>In the preference page Workbench >> Startup this plugin is listed and 
		checked by default. This is essential to have the correct Quickmark 
		icons shown left to the editor when Eclipse is started. If you uncheck 
		this, the Quickmarks continue to work correctly, but are shown only 
		with a default icon (a decorated arrow right) in all editors open on 
		workbench startup.</p>
	<p>

			title="startup preferences"/></p>

	<h2>9. Preferences</h2>
	<p>You might want to configure the Quickmark preferences. They are found 
		under the Workbench preferences. See <a 
		href="preference.html">Preference options</a> for a description of the 
		options.</p>
