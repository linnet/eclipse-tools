	<h1 class="head">Quickmarks Plugin: Switching Styles</h1>
	<h2>"M" company style</h2>
	<p>If you prefer to work with Quickmarks "M company Style" (only 3 key 
		bindings instead of 20, but 'toggling' through your scope only, no 
		'mark move') you can configure this plugin to do that. A mild form 
		would be to have the Quickmarks 1-9 to still work "B company style", 
		and use Quickmark 0 to work "M company Style" (the best of both 
		worlds):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>choose the <a href="preference.html#multiple">option to have dups 
			all the time</a></li>
		<li>redefine the binding for <em>Set/Delete Mark 0</em> to, say, <em 
			class="Key">Shift+Ctrl+F12</em>, the binding for <em>Go to next 
			Mark 0</em> to <em class="Key">Ctrl+F12</em> and the binding for 
			<em>Go to previous Mark 0</em> to <em 
			class="Key">Shift+F12</em></li>
		<li>set the scope to <em>document</em> (or whatever you prefer)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now you can use the Quickmark 0 in your preferred style, and optionally
		still use all other nine Quickmarks.</p>
	<p>An extreme form would be to even unbind all the keys for Quickmarks 1-9 
		additionally. As this is much work to do we deliver another 
		<code>plugin.xml.msstyle</code>. If you really want to only work with 
		this (e.g. to get the key bindings available for other actions), 
		then:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>if you run Quickmarks under Eclipse 3 then be sure to have 
				read <a href="visibility.html#eclipse3">this very important 
				note</a> and follow the procedure outlined, to avoid any 
				pitfalls!</strong>
		</li>
		<li>stop Eclipse</li>
		<li>rename <code>plugin.xml</code> to <code>plugin.xml.original</code></li>
		<li>copy <code>plugin.xml.msstyle</code> over <code>plugin.xml</code></li>
		<li>start Eclipse</li>
		<li>open the Quickmark <a 
			href="preference.html#multiple">preferences</a> and check the 
			option to have dups all the time</li>
		<li>set your scope preference to <em>document</em> (for really pure
			MS style) or the scope you prefer</li>
		<li>better set the delete option to 'same line'</li>
		<li><a href="preference.html#pattern">edit the Quickmarks name</a> to, 
			say, <code>"Quickmark at line {1}"</code></li>
		<li>be sure to (again) configure all perspectives to enable Quickmarks, 
			where you want to have them</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you have done this, the menu has changed:</p>
	<p><img src="../img/menu-ms.gif" alt="" 
			title="the menu in pure MS style"/></p>
	<p><a href="evidence.html#menu">Compare to the default</a>. The key binding 
		section in the preferences is changed accordingly: there are only 3 
		actions left to bind keys to. Other changes are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Now there are also toolbar buttons.</li>
		<li>The Quickmark icon left to any editor shows as an arrow pointing right.</li>
		<li>The plugin doesn't requiere early startup anymore and isn't listed there.</li>
	</ul>

	<a id="purist" name="purist"></a>
	<h2>Pure "B" company style</h2>
	<p>If you prefer to work with the original key bindings <em 
		class="Key">Ctrl+0-9</em> for jumping to a Quickmark instead of the 
		default ones <em class="Key">Alt+0-9</em>, then you might manually
		redefine all the bindings yourself.</p>
	<p>Or you may use the delivered *.bstyle files:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>if you run Quickmarks under Eclipse 3 then be sure to have 
				read <a href="visibility.html#eclipse3">this very important 
				note</a> and follow the procedure outlined, to avoid any 
				pitfalls!</strong>
		</li>
		<li>stop Eclipse</li>
		<li>rename <code>plugin.xml</code> to <code>plugin.xml.original</code></li>
		<li>copy <code>plugin.xml.bstyle</code> over <code>plugin.xml</code></li>
		<li>rename <code>plugin.properties</code> to <code>plugin.properties.original</code></li>
		<li>copy <code>plugin.properties.bstyle</code> over <code>plugin.properties</code></li>
		<li>start Eclipse</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note however, that there are 2 key binding conflicts:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>'Go to Quickmark 1' bound to <em class="Key">Ctrl+1</em> is hidden 
			in the Java editor by 'Quickfix' bound to the same key</li>
		<li>'Go to Quickmark 2' bound to <em class="Key">Ctrl+2</em> is hidden
			in 'Emacs' configuration by 'Set mark' bound to the same key</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Especially the 'Quickfix' is so important when developing Java code, that
		most people might not consider rebinding that action. If you are one of
		them you must live without Quickmark 1 or (inconsistently) jump to it
		with <em class="Key">Alt+1</em> bound to 'Go to previous Quickmark 1'
		or by means of the <a href="evidence.html#menu">menu</a>. If you decide
		to live without Quickmark 1 then you better unbind 'Set Quickmark 1'
		to not accidentally set it anywhere.</p>
	<h3>Suggestion for rebinding "Quickfix"</h3>
	<p>I always wondered, why <em class="Key">Ctrl+1</em> was used for 
		"Quickfix", a much better binding seems <em class="Key">Ctrl+Q</em> to 
		me, which is even a little bit better reachable with short fingers. But 
		<em class="Key">Ctrl+Q</em> is bound to "Go to Last Edit Location" ... 
		now what, where is the 'Q' in that actions name??! And it is the 
		<em>only</em> action using any modifier combination together with the 
		letter 'Q'. And it seems to be closely related to "Back" and "Forward", 
		which are bound to <em class="Key">Alt+Arrow_Left</em> and <em 
		class="Key">Alt+Arrow_Right</em> respectively. And <em 
		class="Key">Alt+Arrow_Up</em> is free! So I suggest:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>rebind "Go to Last Edit Location" to <em class="Key">Alt+Arrow_Up</em></li>
		<li>rebind "Quickfix" to the now available <em class="Key">Ctrl+Q</em></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Suggestion for rebinding "Set mark" in "Emacs" configuration</h3>
	<p>If you are an Emacs purist, then you probably havn't this extension 
		installed anyway, have you? If you work mostly with the 'point and mark'
		concept of Emacs and only occasionally use other Quickmarks then you
		might again just don't use Quickmark 2. Else:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>rebind "Set mark" to <em class="Key">Ctrl+M</em>, which is unused.</li>
	</ul>
