	<h1 class="head">Quickmarks Plugin: Changing visibility in views</h1>
	<p>If you don't like to have Quickmarks in Task and/or Bookmarks view you 
		must edit the <code>plugin.xml</code> of this plugin.</p>

	<a id="eclipse3" name="eclipse3"></a>
	<h2>Important note for Eclipse 3.0 users</h2>
	<p>Before you change the <code>plugin.xml</code> in any way <strong>be sure 
		to remove any and all Quickmarks set!</strong> If you don't, then 
		you'll receive error messages from the views you have disabled and 
		thei'll continue to show the old Quickmarks (not functional though). 
		And you can't get rid of both, errors and stale marks, at least not 
		easily!!!</p>
	<p>Also better <strong>disable the Quickmarks feature</strong> before 
		changing the <code>plugin.xml</code> by: Help >> Software Updates >> 
		Manage Configuration ... Locate the "Quickmarks 1.x.x" in the tree 
		under "Eclipse Platform" and select it. On the right side click on 
		"Disable". When asked to restart Eclipse, choose no. Instead exit 
		Eclipse then and change the <code>plugin.xml</code> as 
		desired/described below.</p>
	<p>After the change you must re-enable the feature by: again Help >> 
		Software Updates >> Manage Configuration ... Then be sure to have the 
		button "Show Disabled Features" activated, else you won't see the 
		Quickmarks. Locate "Quickmarks 1.x.x" as above and click on it in the 
		tree. On the right side click "Enable". When asked to restart Eclipse 
		this time choose "OK". After the restart customize the perspectives 
		again to enable the Quickmarks. If you have choosen to show the 
		Quickmarks in any view, that has a filter (all three, Bookmarks, 
		Problem and Task view have filter settings in Eclipse 3) then look at 
		the filter settings and enable "Quickmark" to have them actually 
		shown!</p>
	<p>If you strictly follow this procedure the Quickmarks <em>should</em> 
		work with the changed settings then and without any problem. Otherwise 
		restart Eclipse 3 once more (Eclipse 3 seems to cache much more, than 
		Eclipse 2.1 did, even invalid things)! But if you forgot to delete all 
		existing Quickmarks, then best revert back to your previous 
		configuration, then follow this procedure again 
		<strong>carefully</strong>!</p>
	<p>And there are 2 more things to note for Eclipse 3:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Having Quickmarks shown in more than 1 view, which works easily in 
			Eclipse 2.1, does not work in Eclipse 3 anymore. E.g. with default 
			settings (Bookmark and Problem view configured) the Quickmarks show 
			correctly in the Bookmark view, but not really in the Problem view 
			(although they are listed in the filter settings of the Problem 
			view they are inconsistently <strong>not</strong> shown in the view 
			itself, even when enabled)! So better choose the one and only view 
			to show them in, we suggest the Bookmarks or the Task view for 
			Eclipse 3, both are normally much less cluttered than the Problem 
			view and all 3 have filter settings in Eclipse 3. A bug report to 
			the Eclipse team regarding this wrong behaviour will be issued 
			soon.</li>
		<li>
			<p>Having Quickmarks shown in any view in Eclipse 3 disables the 
				display of the special Quickmarks icons (the decorated 
				numbers). This is due to, hmmm, let's call it "not a really 
				good" implementation of the internal 
				MarkerImageProviderRegistry, but to most extent our fault, as 
				we are using "internal API" (see <a 
				href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=69894">Eclipse 
				Bug 69894</a> for an enhancement request to make marker image 
				providers public API and more details about the 
				MarkerImageProviderRegistry, feel free to <a 
				href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/votes.cgi?action=show_user&amp;bug_id=69894">vote 
				for this request</a> :-).</p>
			<p>If you prefer to have the special icons instead of a display in 
				one of the standard views, then change the Quickmarks super 
				type to <code>"org.eclipse.core.resources.marker"</code>, as 
				described below!</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We are sorry for the inconvenience for Eclipse 3 users, but most of 
		these issues seem not to be our fault (except for the special images, 
		because of our use of internal API). And this all has nothing to do 
		with the Quickmarks beeing an Eclipse 2.1 feature run in compatibility 
		mode on Eclipse 3: first implementations of a native Eclipse 3 
		Quickmarks feature reveal the very same issues!</p>

	<h2>How to change the visibility in views</h2>
	<p>Locate <code>plugin.xml</code> under 
		<code>&lt;ECLIPSE&gt;/plugins/net.sourceforge.eclipsetools.quickmarks_1.x.x</code> 
		and load it into any text editor. Find the extension 
		<code>point="org.eclipse.core.resources.markers"</code> subtag 
		<code>&lt;super&gt;</code>. As delivered there are two of them:</p>
	<pre>
    &lt;super
        type="org.eclipse.core.resources.problemmarker"&gt;
    &lt;/super&gt;
    &lt;super
        type="org.eclipse.core.resources.bookmark"&gt;
    &lt;/super&gt;
	</pre>
	<p>You can remove one or the other or even change the type. Another usable 
		type you might want to try instead of the problemmarker is 
		<code>"org.eclipse.core.resources.taskmarker"</code>.</p>
	<p>This will turn the task view display of the Quickmarks:</p>
	<p>
		<img src="../img/task_edited.gif" alt="" 
			title="Quickmark in the task view editable and deletable"/>
	</p>
	<p>Now the Quickmarks are shown similar to normal tasks: the description is 
		easily editable and the mark deletable in the task view! You can check 
		a Quickmark as beeing done/obsolete and then delete all obsolete ones 
		in one action from the task views menu. Note however, that even while 
		the Quickmarks <em>look</em> like normal tasks they <em>remain to be 
		Quickmarks</em>, considered for automatic deletion by a Quickmark move 
		or delete. Any message added to the Quickmark is silently lost. So 
		don't edit important comments into your Quickmarks, add a real task or 
		bookmark at that location instead!</p>
	<p>Why isn't this done by default? It's just that similarity to real tasks 
		with the potential loss of important messages and the fact, that 
		clicking the description immediately takes one into editing mode 
		instead of jumping to the mark in the first place.</p>
	<p> To don't show the Quickmarks in any view, thus beeing only visible in 
		the side bars of editors (and have the special icons shown in Eclipse 
		3) choose only to have the super type 
		<code>"org.eclipse.core.resources.marker"</code>.</p>
	<p>If you don't want the Quickmarks to be persisted over Eclipse sessions 
		remove the <code>&lt;persistent&gt;</code> tag directly following the 
		<code>&lt;super&gt;</code> tags. Restart Eclipse to see your 
		changes.</p>
