	<h1 class="head">Quickmarks Plugin (Both Styles)</h1>
	<p>This extension enables you to set, move, delete and jump to text markers 
		by one key stroke only, without having to fill in dialog fields.</p>
	<p>As delivered this plugin behaves similar to "B" company style, 
		where the keys 0-9 together with some modifier keys are used to 
		set/move/delete or jump to a mark with that number, switching/opening 
		editors, if neccessary.</p>
	<p>The key binding for this style is well known: <em 
		class="Key">Shift+Ctrl+#</em> sets/moves/deletes a mark with the 
		number&nbsp;# and <em class="Key">Ctrl+#</em> jumps to it (where '#' 
		stands for one of the keys/integers 0-9).</p>
	<p>As especially <em class="Key">Ctrl+1</em> is by default bound to the 
		<strong>most important</strong> JavaEditor "Quick Fix" command, we 
		decided to rebind the "Go to Quickmark" actions to <em 
		class="Key">Alt+#</em> (purists might want to look at <a 
		href="html/reference/styles.html#purist">How to have default 
		"B" company key bindings</a>).</p>
	<p>As you might guess from the plugins name, you can change it to behave 
		similar to "M" company style. With this style there are only 3 key 
		bindings for the actions used, you can have multiple marks too, even 
		more than 10. But they are not targetable directly, jumping to them 
		happens by toggling through all existing ones. Jumping around is 
		restricted to the current document also, so there is no editor 
		switching/opening (though mine is lon... errmhh, this plugin can do 
		different and better) and a "move" of a mark is missing too.</p>
	<p>The key bindings for that style are also well known: <em 
		class="Key">Ctrl+F2</em> sets/deletes a Quickmark, <em 
		class="Key">F2</em> jumps to the <em>next</em> Quickmark and <em 
		class="Key">Shift+F2</em> jumps to the <em>previous</em> Quickmark.</p>
	<p>2 of these 3 key bindings are used by Eclipse 2.1 already, so we suggest 
		(and defaulted to) another binding: <em class="Key">Shift+Ctrl+F12</em> 
		to <strong>set</strong> a Quickmark, <em class="Key">Ctrl+F12</em> to 
		jump to the <strong>next</strong> and <em class="Key">Shift+F12</em> to 
		jump to the <strong>previous</strong> Quickmark. In our installations 
		(with several other extensions installed) these bindings are unused 
		(<em class="Key">F12</em> <em>is</em> used in Standard and Emacs 
		configuration).</p>
	<p>If you prefer this style be sure to read <a 
		href="reference/styles.html">switching styles</a> to get it whitout 
		having to re/unbind 21 keys manually.</p>
	<p>But note, that this plugin easily <em>combines</em> both styles, to give 
		you the best of both worlds. Read the docs, especially <a 
		href="html/reference/preference.html">have a look at the plugins 
		preference page</a> to learn, what this plugin can do for you.</p>

	<h2>How to get it</h2>
	<p>You probably have done this already, but if not, you can download the 
		plugin at:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a 
		href="http://eclipse-tools.sourceforge.net/quickmarks/">http://eclipse-tools.sourceforge.net/quickmarks/</a> 
		</p>
	<p>as a ZIP file.</p>

	<h2>How to install it</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Stop Eclipse, if it is running.</li>
		<li>Remove any previous installation of 
			net.sourceforge.eclipsetools.quickmarks (and, just in case, any 
			de.re.quickmarks* and also any dk.kampstruplinnet.quickmarks*).</li>
		<li>Copy the ZIP parallel to your Eclipse folder (e.g. if your Eclipse 
			is installed at C:\eclipse then copy the zip to 
			C:\net.sourceforge.eclipsetools.quickmarks_1.x.x.zip) and unzip it. 
			It will install to the correct locations 
			(&lt;ECLIPSE&gt;/plugins/net.sourceforge.eclipsetools.quickmarks_1.x.x) and
			(&lt;ECLIPSE&gt;/features/net.sourceforge.eclipsetools.quickmarks_1.x.x).</li>
		<li>Remove the ZIP.</li>
		<li>Restart Eclipse.</li>
		<li>Customize all of your perspectives that should have the Quickmarks 
			enabled and check 'Other >> Quickmarks Both Styles' (the Quickmarks 
			are available automatically in all perspectives not yet 
			customized).</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Documentation</h2>
	<p>The Quickmarks are well documented at runtime of Eclipse, including 
		context sensitive help, where appropriate.</p>
	<p><a href="html/how_to_use.html">Preview/see the runtime docs!</a></p>

	<h2>Known Bugs and Problems</h2>
	<p>none with this plugin yet, but:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>there are several Editors where marks ain't settable at all. Namely 
			the PDE multi page editor for <code>plugin.xml</code>, even in it's 
			"Source" sub page does not allow marks to be set, though it appears 
			to look like a full blown editor and is read/write. Same with the 
			<code>build.properties</code> editor. Another evidence is the read 
			only editor you open by jumping to the definition of some 
			class/instance/method ending up in a class file. And another common 
			case is an editor opened from within the "Plug-ins" view, usually 
			ending up in the source of something packed inside some JAR, not 
			editable and not markable too. It's a pitty, marks of any flavour 
			would make life easier there too, but Eclipse doesn't allow them 
			there. So the Quickmarks plugin falls back to just message the fact 
			to you in the statusline.</li>
		<li>deleting/cutting text blocks with a (Quick)mark in it behaves 
			somewhat strange: if the mark is at the very beginning of the 
			block, the mark remains at the current line, but now marks 
			irrelevant content. If the mark is somewhere in the middle of the 
			block the mark disappears completely, which is OK when deleting, 
			but I expected the mark to reappear on a paste or undo operation. I 
			don't think, this is my fault, it happens with standard bookmarks 
			too.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

	<p>This plugin was based heavily on the work of Jesper Kamstrup Linnet, who 
		released a simpler plugin for Eclipse 3.x. See also <a 
		href="http://eclipse-tools.sourceforge.net/quickmarks/">http://eclipse-tools.sourceforge.net/quickmarks/</a>.</p>

	<p>I used much of Jespers ideas, style and code. My addition, driven by the 
		fact, that duplicate Quickmarks can occur when closing/reopening 
		Eclipse projects, mainly constitutes in the addition of the Quickmarks 
		preference page and the smart handling of duplicate Quickmarks. The 
		option to have different selections remembered in the marks comes from 
		my old implementation of a "M" company style Quickmarks plugin, never 
		really published. The idea to have this plugin resemble best of both 
		worlds came while implementing and testing this variant.</p>

	<p>So this is an extension to Jespers work, intended for 2.1.x, but running 
		under Eclipse 3.0 too!.</p>

	<h2>Thanks</h2>

	<p>To Jesper, naturally, as noted.</p>
	<p>After I understood the basics of Eclipse this extension was so easy to 
		implement, that I have to thank for sure:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the Sun Java team for providing me with this great language</li>
		<li>all people at Sun <em>documenting</em></li>
		<li>the Eclipse team for providing me with such a fascinating "for 
			nothing in particular" platform, all the sample code available to 
			me, and especially all them, documenting how to use what they 
			did; and them doing it for others.</li>
		<li>many contributors for their great code to borrow from and their 
			docs to read</li>
	</ul>
