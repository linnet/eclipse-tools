         <p>The purpose of the Eclipse-Tools project is to develop plugins for the Eclipse platform.</p>
         <p>Currently, the project has released three plugins<ul>
             <li>A Call Hierarchy View</li>
             <li>An Implementors plugin</li>
             <li>A Multi Project Transfer plugin</li>
         </ul></p>
         <subsection name="Call Hierarchy View">
            <p>The Call Hierarchy plugin is an Eclipse view for showing calls to or calls from a method.</p>
         </subsection>
         <subsection name="Implementors">
            <p>The Implementors plugins add the possibility to jump to a method declaration in a implementation
            class instead of an interface.</p>
            <p>The jumping to implementing methods works for plain Java files. In addition, when associating EJB
            deployment descriptors with a project, the plugin is made aware of the connection between the EJB interfaces
            and the implementation class, something which is not specified in the implementation class itself.</p>
         </subsection>
         <subsection name="Multi Project Transfer">
            <p>The Multi Project Transfer plugin are wizards for exporting or importing multiple projects at a time.</p>
