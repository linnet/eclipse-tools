             <p>The plugin requires Eclipse 3.x.
             It's been tested with Eclipse 3.0.2 and 3.2 on Windows XP.
             It does <b>NOT</b> work on Eclipse 2.x. See below for a version for Eclipse 2.x.</p>

      <section name="Download version 1.0.11 (for Eclipse 2.1.x)">
         <p>This version of the plugin may be downloaded 
         <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=72684">here</a>.
         </p>
         <p>For an Eclipse 3.x version, see above.</p>
         <subsection name="Requirements">
            <p>This variant is made for Eclipse 2.1. It's been tested with 
               Eclipse 2.1.3 on Windows XP. It <b>does</b> however work well in 
               Eclipse 3.x by means of the 'compatibility mode' contained in 
               Eclipse 3. The things not working as expected in Eclipse 3 can't 
               even be fixed by a native 3.0 version. See below and the docs 
               coming with the plugin.</p>
            <p>In Eclipse 2.1.3 the Quickmarks display easily in more than one 
               standard view (e.g. task view and bookmarks view) at the same 
               time. This seems to not work any longer in Eclipse 3. As 
               delivered the Quickmarks show up correctly only in the 3.x 
               bookmarks view. The problem view refuses to display them in it's 
               list, although it does recognize them halfway by 
               <em>offering</em> Quickmarks to be shown in it's filter 
               settings.</p>
