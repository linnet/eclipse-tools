      <section name="Quickmarks">
         <p>This plugin adds "quickmarks" (i.e. quick bookmarking) functionality by simple key strokes without having to fill in dialogs.
         The plugin is inspired by the work by Florin (chronos21F (-at-) hotmail.com) as 
         "published" on <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=22491">Bugzilla on Eclipse.org</a> and
         this other <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=6698">Eclipse bug report</a>. The plugin has subsequently
         been enhanced heavily by Georg Rehfeld (who is responsible for practically all development following version 1.0.1).</p>

		 <p>The plugin exists in an Eclipse 2.1.x and an Eclipse 3.x version. Please select the appropriate version on the download page.</p>

         <subsection name="Features">
            <p>With this plugin it is possible to work in 
               both styles around, "B" company style (default) with 10 directly 
               settable/jumpable Quickmarks, switching/opening editors when 
               neccessary, and "M" company style with only 3 key bindings, an 
               unlimited number of Quickmarks, but having to toggle through 
               them forward/backward. It is also fairly configurable to give 
               you the best of both worlds. And it comes with detailed online 
               documentation.</p>
