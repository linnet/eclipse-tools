        <p>
        The Implementors plugin needs to be made aware of EJB deployment descriptors in order to be able to
        jump to implementation/interface.
        </p>
        <p>
        In order to do this, right click on a Java project and show the properties.
        Here, you can enable or disable the EJB awareness of the project. When EJB awareness is enabled, it's possible
        to add deployment descriptors (ejb-jar.xml) which refer to interfaces (remote, remote home, local, and local home)
        as well as to the implementing class. You may add multiple deployment descriptors.
        </p>
